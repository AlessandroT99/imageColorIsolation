imageColorIsolation
-------------------
Software used to isolate from images 3 yellow markers representing pointing of a wire, and to evaluate distances and angles between these points, in order to characterize the wire state.   
Added also a bash file which transforms .ppm file into a .mp4 video following a predefined sequence of folders as input data.
